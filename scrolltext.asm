!text "... welcome to lane crazy ...   a fun party game which is guaranteed to drive you "
!text "insane if you lose the game too much that is :-) ...   code, graphics (except for logo) and "
!text "music were all done by me, starhawk ...   while firelord did the rest of the "
!text "painting ...   and now i give you the instructions ...   "
!text "this game is controlled using keys a,s,d,f, or h,j,k,l or perhaps both ...   you can also use a joystick in either port "
!text "...   you have four "
!text "balls lined up in each lane ...   the idea of this game is to keep all of your rolling balls in play "
!text "and keep on scoring points on-going ...   the only thing you must avoid is falling down the holes that will appear at random ...   "
!text "if one of your rolling balls fall through a hole, the game will be over leaving you with your final score ...   points are scored in units of 10 "
!text "per distance travelled ...   if a hole appears in front of your ball, you should swap the horizontal position of your ball by pressing the "
!text "keys indicated earlier in the instructions ...   or use joystick corresponding to the arrows "
!text "underneath each lane ...   units in 100 points are scored for every hole you "
!text "have passed on your travel ...   there are eight levels in total, where even more holes will start to appear ...   "
!text "after level 4, the lanes become more steeper ...   keep on scoring those points, and try to "
!text "make a place in the hall of fame, if you can ...   have fun ...   press spacebar or fire to start ...   "
